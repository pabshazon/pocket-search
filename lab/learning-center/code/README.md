### 1. Code Completion/Generation Pipeline
Build a pipeline that can understand code context and generate appropriate completions using a transformer model. The system should:

* Take code context (previous lines + cursor position)
* Generate relevant code completions
* Filter and rank completions based on code quality metrics
* Handle multiple programming languages"

* Why: This directly tests your ability to work on core functionality of intelligent code completion.

### 2. Code Understanding & Analysis
Create a system that can analyze a given code snippet and:

* Extract its functional dependencies 
* Identify potential bugs or improvements 
* Generate natural language explanations of the code 
* Provide relevant documentation references"

* Why: Shows your ability to work on code understanding features that help developers comprehend and navigate codebases.


### 3. Interactive Code Editing Pipeline
Implement a real-time system that can:

* Accept natural language commands from users about code changes 
* Parse and understand the existing code structure 
* Generate appropriate code modifications 
* Handle edge cases like syntax errors and incomplete code"

* Why: Tests your ability to work on natural language to code transformation features.
